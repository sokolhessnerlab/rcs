## Choice set design for risky decision-making, context and strategy (RCS; HRB's dissertation study)

### Goal
To create a shortened version of previous choice sets (especially VNI) without sacrificing precision and power.

### Choice set parameters
1) Levels of context (defined by expected value)
2) Number of runs
3) Number of shifts (related to #2)
4) Number of trials
5) One extra run (5 trials) to shift back to starting level

- The levels of context, shifts and runs will be fully crossed 
  -   i.e. each participant experiences the same shifts to-and-from each level and the same number of total trials at each run (with the exception of the last run)

### Parameter Recovery
