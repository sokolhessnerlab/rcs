# Symmetry Span Task (shortened version)
# Foster et al (2014), Memory and Cognition

## Task summary:
- In this task, participants view images that are either symmetrical or nonsymmetrical across a red vertical line and rate whether the images are symmetrical. The symmetry ratings are considered distractors. Then participants briefly view a 4x4 matrix of squares, one of which is red. The location of the red square is the “to-be-remembered” item. On each trial, the number of sets, or the number of symmetry-red square pairs range from 2-5. At the end of each trial, participants report the location and order of each red square in a trial. The goal of the task is to accurately recall the location of the red squares.
