# RCS Analysis Notes and Summary
## For Hayley's Dissertation Project on risky decision-making, temporal context and cognitive strategies

### Study at-a-glance
In this study, participants completed two rounds of a risky decision-making task (after consent and substance use questionnaire). Prior to each round of the task, participants were randomly assigned to receive instructions to either act natural or to ignore context (strategy) in a fully-crossed manner resulting in 4 groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, and strategy-strategy. Following each round of the decision-making task, participants reported the difficulty, and frequency of following the instructions (on a scale from 1-100 with 1 = easy or never and 100 = most difficult or all the time). Participants were shown the outcome of a randomly selected trial following each round of the task and then one of the two outcomes were randomly selected for payment once both rounds were complete.

After participants completed the risky decision-making task, they completed two complex span tasks (the OSpan and SymSpan tasks), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire.


### Basic participant information (inc. demographic info)
- We collected data for a total of 134 participants. After exclusion criteria was applied, we have a total of 124 participants evenly distributed across the four groups (n=31/group). 

- Across the 124 participants and both rounds we have a total 32,414 choices (after removing missed trials, more details below).


#### Exclusion across all tasks and missed trial information for RDM

- RDM task: there are 5 predetermined exclusion criteria and participants needed to pass 4 or more to be included in all analyses. Participants were additionally excluded if they reported that their choices were influenced by other things outside of task parameters and/or made it clear that they did not understand the task (e.g. pressed both response buttons at the same time). Because the risky decision-making task is the task of interest, if participants were excluded from the RDM analysis, they were excluded from all analyses. Of the 134 participants:
	- 8 were excluded for failing criteria above
	- 2 were excluded for indicating that they did not understand task or that their choices reflected something other than values on the screen or other task parameters.

Across the 124 participants included in the analysis, there were a total of 74 trials (median missed trial across both rounds = 0). 

#### Demographic
- Gender: 80 female, 40 male, 1 trans male, 2 gender nonconforming, 1 other; 
- Age: mean(sd) age: 19.24(1.78) years, median age: 19 years, range: 18-32 years  
- Ethnicity: 15 hispanic or latino and 115 not hispanic or latino.
- Race: white = 101; Black or African American = 2; American Indian and Alaskan Native = 1; Asian = 8; two or more races = 10; 2 decline to answer


- Complex span tasks: Participants had to maintain 85% accuracy on the overall math and symmetry judgements to ensure that participants were not trading off recall accuracy with distractor accuracy. Individuals who did not maintain 85% on a given task, were only excluded from analyses involving that task (i.e. participants were not excluded across both complex span tasks if they only failed on one of the tasks). Of the 124 participants:
	- 14 participants were excluded from SymSpan for not passing symmetry scoring criteria
	- 11 participants were excluded from the OSpan for not passing symmetry scoring criteria
	- 2 additional participants were excluded from both for not completing the tasks
	- 15 total excluded from SymSpan; 12 total excluded from OSpan; including 4 participants who were excluded from both.


### Basic RDM stats (inc. p(gamble), condition stats, post-round/task questions)
#### Probability of gambling
  - round 1: mean = 0.533754
  - round 2: mean = 0.5343  (paired t-test shows this is not a significant difference)
