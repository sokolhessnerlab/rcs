# RCS Analysis Notes and Summary
## For Hayley's Dissertation Project on risky decision-making, temporal context and cognitive strategies

### Study at-a-glance
In this study, participants completed two rounds of a risky decision-making task (after consent and substance use questionnaire). Prior to each round of the task, participants were randomly assigned to receive instructions to either act natural or to ignore context (strategy) in a fully-crossed manner resulting in 4 groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, and strategy-strategy. Following each round of the decision-making task, participants reported the difficulty, and frequency of following the instructions (on a scale from 1-100 with 1 = easy or never and 100 = most difficult or all the time). Participants were shown the outcome of a randomly selected trial following each round of the task and then one of the two outcomes were randomly selected for payment once both rounds were complete.

After participants completed the risky decision-making task, they completed two complex span tasks (the OSpan and SymSpan tasks), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire.


### Basic participant information (inc. demographic info)
- We collected data for a total of 134 participants. After exclusion criteria was applied, we have a total of 124 participants evenly distributed across the four groups (n=31/group). 

- Across the 124 participants and both rounds we have a total 32,414 choices (after removing missed trials, more details below).


#### Exclusion across all tasks and missed trial information for RDM

- RDM task: there are 5 predetermined exclusion criteria and participants needed to pass 4 or more to be included in all analyses. Participants were additionally excluded if they reported that their choices were influenced by other things outside of task parameters and/or made it clear that they did not understand the task (e.g. pressed both response buttons at the same time). Because the risky decision-making task is the task of interest, if participants were excluded from the RDM analysis, they were excluded from all analyses. Of the 134 participants:
	- 8 were excluded for failing criteria above
	- 2 were excluded for indicating that they did not understand task or that their choices reflected something other than values on the screen or other task parameters.

Across the 124 participants included in the analysis, there were a total of 74 trials (median missed trial across both rounds = 0). 

#### Demographic
- Gender: 80 female, 40 male, 1 trans male, 2 gender nonconforming, 1 other; 
- Age: mean(sd) age: 19.24(1.78) years, median age: 19 years, range: 18-32 years  
- Ethnicity: 15 hispanic or latino and 115 not hispanic or latino.
- Race: white = 101; Black or African American = 2; American Indian and Alaskan Native = 1; Asian = 8; two or more races = 10; 2 decline to answer


- Complex span tasks: Participants had to maintain 85% accuracy on the overall math and symmetry judgements to ensure that participants were not trading off recall accuracy with distractor accuracy. Individuals who did not maintain 85% on a given task, were only excluded from analyses involving that task (i.e. participants were not excluded across both complex span tasks if they only failed on one of the tasks). Of the 124 participants:
	- 14 participants were excluded from SymSpan for not passing symmetry scoring criteria
	- 9 participants were excluded from the OSpan for not passing symmetry scoring criteria
	- 2 additional participants were excluded from both for not completing the tasks
	- 16 total excluded from SymSpan; 11 total excluded from OSpan; including 4 participants who were excluded from both.


### Basic RDM stats (inc. p(gamble), condition stats, post-round/task questions)
#### Probability of gambling by round
  - round 1: mean = 0.533754
  - round 2: mean = 0.5343  (paired t-test shows this is not a significant difference)
  - Suggests there is no strong effect of round on its own.
  
  - Probability of gambling across round/condition: When participants switch conditions, there is more risk-taking after being told to ignore context regardless of order. There is less risk-taking over time for those who do natural both rounds (consistent with previous research, e.g. PSH 2016) and there is more risk-taking over time for those who do strategy both rounds.

#### Instruction difficulty and frequency
   - DIFFICULTY RATINGS:
    - nat-nat: Difficulty ratings increased across rounds (round 1 mean = 27.48, range = 1-64.4; round 2 mean = 36.489, range = 1.76-79.6)
    - nat-strat: Difficulty ratings increased across rounds (round 1 mean = 31.55, range = 1-77.64 ; round 2 mean = 41.78, range = 2.64-92.58)
    - strat-nat: Difficulty ratings were slightly lower across rounds (round 1 mean = 1 -99.8; round 2 mean = 28.30, range = 1-76.17)
    - strat-strat: Difficulty ratings were slightly lower across rounds (round 1 mean = 33.84, range = 1-87; round 2 mean = 30.15, range = 2.9-86.8)
    * this seems unusual - there isn't a clear pattern that is making a lot sense here. Even comparing natural vs. strategy for people who did natural and those who did strategy first, doesn't show a clear picture either.
    * Could look at change in ratings 
    
    
   - FREQUENCY RATINGS:
    - nat-nat: ratings roughly the same across rounds  (means ~73)
    - nat-strat: frequency rating less in strategy condition (nat, round 1 mean = 76.87; strat, round 2 mean = 69.22, t-test p = .04)
    - strat-nat: frequency rating less in strategy condition (strat, round 1 mean = 76.97; nat, round 2 mean = 78.4)
    - strat-strat: ratings less in round 2 but difference is not significant (round 1 mean = 79.69; round 2 mean = 74.36)
    
    * this pattern seems more clear than difficulty ratings. When people repeat conditions, they follow those instructions roughly the same across the rounds but when people switch, they report following strategy instructions slightly less than natural instructions. 
    
  - REACTION TIMES:
   - nat-nat: round 1 mean = 1.3499; round 2 mean = 1.2174; t-test significant
   - nat-strat: round 1 mean = 1.471; round 2 mean = 1.3779 ; t-test significant
   - strat-nat: round 1 mean = 1.4397; round 2 mean = 1.3208; t-test significant
   - strat-strat: round 1 mean = 1.4071; round 2 mean = 1.3309; t-test not significant
   - Across conditions, participants are faster in round 2.
    
#### Post-task questionnaire: focus on motivation and round independence
  - MOTIVATION: people were generally motivated during the experiment with mean ratings = 5.17 (range = 2-7 on a scale from 1-7). No big difference in motivation across conditions.
  
  - ROUND INDEPENDENCE (i.e. how independent did the rounds feel?): the rounds felt more independent than not (mean = 4.992; median = 5, range = 1-7 on a scale from 1-7). Slight difference in ratings of independence depending on conditio, but the pattern is somewhat odd (e.g. its not systematically varying depending on whether people change instructions). 
      nat-nat mean = 4.48
      nat-strat mean = 5.355
      strat-nat mean = 4.871
      strat-strat mean = 5.258
        
### Basic complex span tasks stats
 OSPAN: range = 0-25; mean =14.53; median = 13
 SYMSPAN: range = 0-14; mean = 7.657; median = 9
 
### Basic ERQ stats
 ERQ REAPPRAISAL: range = 14-42; mean = 29.69; median = 30
 ERQ SUPPRESSION:  range = 4 - 27; mean = 14.89; median = 15

- How does the complex span and ERQ compare to other studies? 

## Temporal context effects! 
### Generalized linear mixed effects modeling
#### Risky decision-making analysis

  Trial-level model: Accounting for option values, magnitude, strategy and round
  
  People are more likely to choose an option as it gets bigger and gamble less as values increase overall. Risk-taking increases in the strategy relative to natural condition and this effect is strongest in round 2.

  Do we see effects of past outcome, positive shift and earnings relative to expectations?
  
  Past outcome alone: trending, negative effect; no interaction with strategy
  Shift: Need to account for both positive and negative shift. Trending effect of positive shift and significant effect of negative shift (more risk-taking with positive shift amount; less risk-taking with negative shift amount)
  Earnings and expectations: Risk-taking increases as earnings are more than expected, decreasese when earnings are less than expected and when earnings are the same as expectations the effect on gambling is very small, but positive. AIC is smaller when including interaction between expectation and earnings (although trending in model alone with no other timescales)
  Past outcome x earnings/expectations: Best model accounts for an interaction between past outcome and earnings and past outcome and expectations. Betas for the interactions are opposite (consistent with what we see with just expectations and earnings betas). When accounting for interaction with past outcome, the main effects of earnings/expectations go away.
  
 Does strategy interact with any of the timescales:
  The effect of positive shift is stronger in the strategy condition (when told to ignore context)
  The effects of past outcome does not change nor does the global timescale (or interaction between immediate and global)

This is the exact opposite of predicted - but one thing does seem to be confirmed which is that the immediate and global timescales appear related/similar and if one changed, we'd expect the other to change.
