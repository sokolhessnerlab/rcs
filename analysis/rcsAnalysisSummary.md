# RCS Analysis Notes and Summary

## For Hayley's Dissertation Project on risky decision-making, temporal context and cognitive strategies

### Study at-a-glance

In this study, participants completed two rounds of a risky decision-making task (after consent and substance use questionnaire).
Prior to each round of the task, participants were randomly assigned to receive instructions to either act natural or to ignore context (strategy) in a fully-crossed manner resulting in 4 groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, and strategy-strategy. Following each round of the decision-making task,participants reported the difficulty, and frequency of following the instructions (on a scale from 1-100 with 1 = easy or never and 100 = most difficult or all the time). Participants were shown the outcome of a randomly selected trial following each round of the task and then one
of the two outcomes were randomly selected for payment once both rounds were complete.

After participants completed the risky decision-making task, they completed two complex span tasks (the OSpan and SymSpan tasks), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and a demographic questionnaire.

### Basic participant information (inc. demographic info)

-   We collected data for a total of 134 participants. After exclusion criteria was applied, we have a total of 124 participants evenly distributed across the four groups (n=31/group).

-   Across the 124 participants and both rounds we have a total 32,414 choices (after removing missed trials, more details below).

#### Exclusion across all tasks and missed trial information for RDM

-   RDM task: there are 5 predetermined exclusion criteria and participants needed to pass 4 or more to be included in all analyses. Participants were additionally excluded if they reported that their choices were influenced by other things outside of task parameters and/or made it clear that they did not understand the task (e.g. pressed both response buttons at the same time). Because the risky decision-making task is the task of interest, if participants were excluded from the RDM analysis, they were excluded from all analyses. Of the 134 participants:
    -   8 were excluded for failing criteria above
    -   2 were excluded for indicating that they did not understand task or that their choices reflected something other than values on the screen or other task parameters.

Across the 124 participants included in the analysis, there were a total of 74 missed trials (median missed trial across both rounds = 0).

#### Demographic

-   Gender: 80 female, 40 male, 1 trans male, 2 gender nonconforming, 1 other;

-   Age: mean(sd) age: 19.24(1.78) years, median age: 19 years, range:18-32 years.

-   Ethnicity: 15 hispanic or latino and 109 not hispanic or latino.

-   Race: white = 101; Black or African American = 2; American Indian and Alaskan Native = 1; Asian = 8; two or more races = 10; 2 decline to answer

-   Complex span tasks: Participants had to maintain 85% accuracy on the overall math and symmetry judgements to ensure that participants were not trading off recall accuracy with distractor accuracy. Individuals who did not maintain 85% on a given task, were only excluded from analyses involving that specific complex span task (i.e. participants were not excluded across both complex span tasks if they only failed on one of the tasks). Of the 124 participants:

    -   14 participants were excluded from SymSpan for not passing symmetry scoring criteria
    -   9 participants were excluded from the OSpan for not passing symmetry scoring criteria
    -   2 additional participants were excluded from both for not completing the tasks
    -   16 total excluded from SymSpan; 11 total excluded from OSpan; including 4 participants who were excluded from both.
    -   we have at least one complex span data point for 120 people (97%)

-   Composite complex span scores: we combined the complex span scores by normalizing each individual score by the max (25 for ospan, 14 for symspan) then took the average of the normalized scores.

### Basic RDM stats (inc. p(gamble), condition stats, post-round/task questions)

#### Probability of gambling by round/condition

-   round 1: mean = 0.5338

-   round 2: mean = 0.5343 (paired t-test shows this is not a
    significant difference)

-   Suggests there is no strong effect of round on its own.

-   Probability of gambling across round/condition: When participants
    switch conditions, there is more risk-taking after being told to
    ignore context regardless of order. There is less risk-taking over
    time for those who do natural both rounds (consistent with previous
    research, e.g. PSH 2016) and there is more risk-taking over time for
    those who do strategy both rounds.

#### Instruction difficulty and frequency

*DIFFICULTY RATINGS: Scale from 1-100* 
- Overall, difficulty ratings ranged, on average between 27-41 across groups. The difficulty patterns are unusual/inconsistent suggesting that using such ratings or means of these ratings is not the best method. 
- When comparing natural vs. strategy as a function of previous strategy (nat-nat vs nat-strat and
strat-nat vs strat-strat), all difficulty ratings following natural instructions are higher (i.e. anything after natural is more difficult -
even nat-nat) and following strategy, the difficulty ratings are lower (i.e. everything is easier following strategy). 
**- Comparing just the first round nat vs. strat, there is no significant difference in difficulty ratings (n=62 in each group; p = .5). So in the "cleanest" analysis, we don't see an effect between the difficulty ratings in the strategy which implies the difficulty is not fundamentally different. **
- Likely can't use this variable as a covariate.

**Instruction difficulty summary stats:**
- Natural-Natural: Difficulty ratings increased across rounds
  - round 1 mean = 27.48, range = 1-64.4
  - round 2 mean = 36.489, range = 1.76-79.6 (significant diff, p = .02)
- Natural-Strategy: Difficulty ratings increased across rounds
  - round 1 mean = 31.55, range = 1-77.64
  - round 2 mean = 41.78, range = 2.64-92.58 (trending diff, p = .09)
- Strategy-Natural: Difficulty ratings were slightly lower across
rounds 
  - round 1 mean = 31.1, range = 1-99.8
  - round 2 mean = 28.30, range = 1-76.17 (n.s., p =.64)
- Strategy-Strategy : Difficulty ratings were slightly lower across rounds 
  - round 1 mean = 33.84, range = 1-87
  - round 2 mean = 30.15, range = 2.9-86.8 (n.s., p=.35)

*FREQUENCY RATINGS: scale from 1 to 100* 
- Overall, participants reported following instructions 70-80% of the time. When participants repeat conditions, frequency ratings are similar. When participants switch conditions, frequency ratings are higher for natural relative to strategy condition but this difference is only significant when going from natural to strategy. There was no significant difference between natural and strategy frequency ratings for people who do natural and strategy first (i.e .when just looking at round 1 data; n=62 each group). 
**- This lines up with story from difficulty - these two conditions don't really vary in terms of their subjective difficulty and how often they can implement the strategy.**

**Instruction frequency summary stats:**

- Natural-Natural: ratings roughly the same across rounds (means~73) 
  - round 1 mean = 73.10, range = 18.36 - 98.73
  - round 2 mean = 72.31, range = 38.18 - 97.66 (n.s. p = .8)
- Natural-Strategy: frequency rating less in strategy condition 
  - round 1 mean = 76.87, range = 48.44 - 99.71
  - round 2 mean =  69.22, range = 22.17 - 99.9 (significant, p =.04)
- Strategy-Natural: frequency rating less in strategy condition 
  - round 1 mean = 76.97, range = 31.05 - 99.12
  - round 2 mean = 78.4, range = 38.77 - 99.9 (n.s., p = .7)
- Strategy-Strategy: ratings less in round 2 
  - round 1 mean = 79.69, range = 35.84 - 98.54
  - round 2 mean = 74.36, range = 25.78 - 99.02 (n.s., p=.15)

*REACTION TIMES:* 
- We looked at reaction time in a few ways, using 1) mean of mean, 2) mean of means with fast trials (<1s) removed, 3) mean of medians, and 4) mean of medians with fast trials (<.5s) removed (14 fast trials across 9 participants in round 1 with a single sub having at most 4 of these trials, 7 fast trials across 6 participants in round 2 with a single sub having at most 2 of these trials)
- We also tested removing trials with RTs <1s which included 7600 trials overall. Each of the 124 participants had at least one of these trials and for some this number of trials was in the 100s. The results are consistent with the analyses reported below for all trials and fast trials removed (RTs<.5s)

-   Overall (across the 4 types of analyses), participants were faster in round 2 relative to round 1 regardless of strategy/order. Looking
    in just round 1 data (nat vs strat, n=62), there were no significant differences in RT by instruction type.
-   **This is also consistent with our takeaways above that the strategy and control conditions take similar resources to implement and experiences are similar across instructions.**

Plot below is mean of median RT plotted for round 1 vs round for each condition:
    ![medianRTAcrossRndsStratPlotsNoFastTrials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19710394/221986838-86d2f596-2b08-4325-ad95-2b055230ae6d.jpg)

-   Increase speed over rounds is likely practice effect at assessing the values. Plot below shows mean RT within each round. Sharpest decrease in RT occurs in first round and slightly decreases across round 2.
![meanRTacrossrounds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19710394/221962030-11844faa-781c-4357-b5cb-615f7b1c3ad3.png)

_Note: not removing these fast trials from all analyses because they could be indicative of contextual effects (e.g. people getting faster as a result of context)_

#### Post-task questionnaire: Motivation and perceived RDM round indepedence

-   MOTIVATION: people were generally motivated during the experiment with mean ratings = 5.17 (range = 2-7 on a scale from 1-7). No big difference in motivation across conditions.

![MotivationHist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19710394/221989751-5825227a-e160-4e59-9de6-6d859f7ab2b2.jpg)


-   ROUND INDEPENDENCE (i.e. how independent did the rounds feel?): participants felt the rounds generally felt independent (mean = 4.992; median = 5,
    range = 1-7 on a scale from 1-7). 
    
    ![RDMroundIndepHist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19710394/221989842-d99b8e61-5749-43ce-9619-66528d6c0f76.jpg)

-   Differences in ratings of independence depending on condition.
    - Natural-Natural mean = 4.48 
    - Natural-Strategy mean = 5.355
    - Strategy-Natural mean = 4.871 
    - Strategy-Strategy mean = 5.258
    - Histograms of independence ratings show that when people switch conditions, they tend to rate independence as higher. Lots of variability when repeating natural. Barely anyone rates low indepenence in strat-strat (makes sense given instructions to ignore previous stuff)

### Basic complex span tasks stats

- OSPAN: range = 0-25; mean =14.53; median = 13 
- SYMSPAN: range = 0-14; mean = 7.657; median = 9 
  - Ospan and symspan are correlated: r = .26, p = .009 
- COMPOSITE: range = .06 - 1; median = .5743; mean = .57. 
  - Wide variation in composite scores - good for individuals variability.
  - 
![compositeSpanScoreHist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19710394/221991618-32ba8264-bfd9-44db-b213-40f35851766e.jpg)

To do:
- Test the correlation coefficient with Foster et al paper with N=589, r = .53 with our correlation here.

_**To what extent is the scoring on these complex span capturing capacity or motivation?**_
We cannot totally rid this possibility, but the data supports that the composite span is a measure of capacity over motivation. They are all achieving the same baseline level of math performance (85% or higher). Not a correlational relationship between motivation and composite span.


### Basic ERQ stats

- ERQ REAPPRAISAL: range = 14-42; mean = 29.69; median = 30 
- ERQ SUPPRESSION: range = 4 - 27; mean = 14.89; median = 15
- No correlation between reappraisal and suppression, p = .4

![ERQHist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19710394/221994792-271a7b1c-3488-4f83-907e-1009fc8e1a6e.jpg)

-   How does the complex span and ERQ compare to other studies?

### Individual-level measures: Are they related?

1. **Is ERQ related to composite span?** No relationship between ERQ suppression and composite span or ERQ reappraisal and composite span.
2. **Is instruction difficulty and frequency related to ERQ, composite span, or motivation?** 
    - Looked at this several ways, each in linear models. 
        - No main effects of composite span, ERQ, and motivation on instruction difficuly and frequency.
        - For difficulty ratings, no interaction with indiv. measurements and strategy.
        - For frequency ratings, main effect of strategy, interation with strategy and motivation. The effects are such that 1) people follow instructions more in strategy condition relative to act natural and 2) when motivation is low, frequency ratings are higher in strategy than natural and vice versa (this doesn't take round into consideration)
        - Accounting for round in a few ways (e.g. used condition code = 1,2,3,4 and then split up data by round). **The takeaway seems to be that the effect of motivation on frequency is negative for strategy condition and is positive for natural condition. High motivation is good for following act natural instructions but bad for following strategy instructions.**


## Temporal context effects!

### Generalized linear mixed effects modeling

#### Risky decision-making analysis

Trial-level model: Accounting for option values, magnitude, strategy and
round

People are more likely to choose an option as it gets bigger and gamble
less as values increase overall. Risk-taking increases in the strategy
relative to natural condition and this effect is strongest in round 2.

#### Do we see effects of past outcome, positive shift and earnings relative to expectations?
Two main (best-fitting) models (generalize linear models - no mixed effects, model breaks with mixed effects)
1) past outcome amount, signed shift amount, earnings and expectations
2) past outcome amount, signed shift amount, earnings and expectations with interaction between past outcome and earnings and past outcome and expectations.

Notes: in the past, models splitting up shift into positive and negative are better fitting, but with this dataset, the signed shift variable has a better AIC.

To do: how far back does signed shift effect go?

#### Does strategy and/or round interact with the three timescales?
