# Study overview
- This study includes two rounds of a risky decision-making task (link file), and two complex span tasks (operation span and symmetry span- link files). 
- Participants were randomly assigned to receive "act natural" or "strategy" instructions prior to each round of the risky decision-making task resulting in four possible groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-natural, strategy-strategy. The conditions are listed here (link file) and were determined using these scripts (older, newer). 
- Each round of the risky decision-making task was marked with green or purple (randomly assigned to each round). This information is also included in the conditions file.
- Each task is in its own directory and the study is run using a primary script that calls the functions for each task.
- Following the computerized task, participants complete post-task questionnaires and this data is currently located on the lab's shared drive (as of 01/11/23 - subject to change upon publication)
