symmetry span task for HRB dissertation project: Risk, context and strategy.

For this study, we are running the shortened version (Foster et al 2014) of both the operation span and symmetry span tasks.
We are doing one block for each. 

The structure of the complex span tasks are very similar: instructions, practice letters/red square only, practice distractors only, the practice both.
