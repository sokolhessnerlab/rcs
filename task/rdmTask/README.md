## Risky decision-making task

### Conditions
Participants were randomly assigned to recieve "act natural" or "strategy" instructions prior to each round of the risky decision-making task and were equally likely to receive either instructions leading to four groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-strategy, strategy-natural. 

These conditions were assigned by this [script](rcsConditionAssignment.py) and then later updated during data collection by this [script](rcsConditionUpdateFile.py) (to balance out number of participants in each group on a weekly-ish basis)

Condition files: [original conditions file](rcsConditionsORIGINAL.csv), [fall 2022 updated condition file](rcsConditions.csv) (adjusting for excluded people from the fall), [winter 2023 updated conditions file](rcsConditionsUpdated_Winter.csv) (for evening out groups on a weekly-ish basis and adjusting for excluded condition groups)
