## Risky decision-making task

### Conditions
Participants were randomly assigned to recieve "act natural" or "strategy" instructions prior to each round of the risky decision-making task and were equally likely to receive either instructions leading to four groups: natural-natural, natural-strategy, strategy-strategy, strategy-natural. 
These conditions were assigned by this [script](rcsConditionAssignment.py) and then later updated during data collection by this [script](rcsConditionUpdateFile.py) (to balance out number of participants in each group)
