```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("pwr")
```

Sample size will be 120 participants, 2 conditions of risky decision-making task, 4 orders:
1) control - strategy
2) control - control
3) strategy - strategy
4) strategy - control

Big question: is there a difference in temporal context effects between control and strategy conditions

What is our power for a t-test looking at whether the context effects at one timescale is different betwen control and strategy conditions on the first round of RDM task (60 in each condition)
```{r correlation}
pwr.t.test(d = .5, sig.level = .05, power = .8, type="two.sample"); # need 64 participants in each group to detect medium effect size with power of .8

pwr.t.test(n=60, d = .5, sig.level = .05, type="two.sample"); # power = 0.7752659
```
